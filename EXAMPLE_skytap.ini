;skytap_env_vars are things you want to set to change the context of how you run the playbook against a skytap environment
;network type should be one of "private", "nat_vpn", or "nat_incr" 

;Environments can have a 'credentials' string set in the UI -- this is a a free-form field containing a string. 
;a common example of a credential string in the UI might look like "someUser / fakePass".  
;each VM may have several credential pairs set; you must specify a username to distinguish between these. 
;the inventory parser will default to a delimiter of '/'; specify the character you use here if it's different.
;any padding spaces will be stripped -- in the case "someUser / fakePass", the resulting tokens are 
; someUser
; fakePass
;these will be set to the ansible_ssh_user and ansible_ssh_pass (respectively) for each host in the inventory
